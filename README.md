Assigncodement
==============

School assignments and projects, such as Arduino, and
exploratory materials to help me explainingly explain
and demonstrate matters.

Cellar Materials are code snippets and sample scripts.
Their purpose is to make my otherwise somewhat semi-incoherent
and hard-to-grasp ramblings more tangible, benefitting both
me as a ranter and the poor souls being subjected perhaps
to actually gain something from my outbursts such as:

"Java is evil, it limits your productivity,
creativity and kills little kittens."

"Awk and Lua are the king and queen of scripting."

"Parentheses are warm and fuzzy, clean and clear."
