Babysteps: Setup

There are a great deal of different implementations of
The Editor, Vi. We will use a more elaborate and modern
variation called Vim, Vi IMproved.


Zero - Insert and normal.

The grandness of editing in Vim are its modes.
There are several, but we are now concerned
only with the two main modes, insert and normal.

Unlike with most editors, in fact, with most things where you input
text, Vim isn't all about just placing the text and then struggling
to do something with it. That is the reason, why Vim's main mode is
in fact, the normal mode. The mode in which the text is before you
and your sole and only purpose is to act upon this text.

Because of this, because of modes, a single keystroke that would
otherwise be used to insert text, as it's done in almost every other
place, is used to do the editor commands. And this is Vim's greatest
strength. This creates a language and a world of it's own.

Vim starts in normal mode. To enter the
insert mode, issue one single command:

i

To return to normal mode, press the Escape key.


First - Disabling the arrow keys. This'll ensure you'll
        stay away from them. Use hjkl instead.

vim ~/.vimrc

And add lines:

imap <up>    <nop>
imap <down>  <nop>
imap <left>  <nop>
imap <right> <nop>
map  <up>    <nop>
map  <down>  <nop>
map  <left>  <nop>
map  <right> <nop>

And return to normal mode and save with ZZ.


Second - Try and stay away from the mouse.


Third - More configuration.

Open .vimrc again, and add these.

filetype indent on

syntax on
set title
set hlsearch
set ruler
set number
set nocompatible
set showcmd

set autoindent
set expandtab
set softtabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4

And again, save with ZZ in normal mode.

The lower block is not "that necessary", but we set it, because
hardtabs are evil, real men use spaces. With these settings, if
you press tab, it'll automagically input 4 spaces instead.

Nocompatible isn't strictly needed, though we set it just in
case, to locally override possible global settings.

As an extra, you could do a little extra mapping:
imap kj <esc>

In insert mode, if you press k and j in quick
succession, it'll act as if you press escape.
I use this one myself. A lot.


Fourth - :help is your friend. Vim comes with a
         comprehensive builtin documentation, use it!

As an exercise, go give a cursory glance of the help texts
for those things we just set in the configuration file.


Next part will be about basic navigation in normal mode.
